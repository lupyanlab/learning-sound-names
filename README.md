# Learning sound names

This is a reproducible cognitive psychology experiment designed to test the hypothesis that people have an easier time learning to associate novel words with categories of sounds when the words being learned are the output of an iterated imitation game, much like the children's game of telephone. We believe that repeating imitations of sounds makes them more wordlike, which means that imitations that have been repeated more times are more likely to take on the property of words that they are categorical and refer to all members of a category. If true, then when learning to associate these words with particular sounds, people should be faster and more accurate to associate particular words with whole categories of sounds when the words are the result of being repeated from person to person between 5 and 8 times.

To run the experiment, run the run.py script:

```bash
$ python run.py
```
